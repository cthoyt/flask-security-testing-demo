flask-security-testing-demo
===========================
A short demo how to test logged in users with Flask-Security. This repository has two parts: a stripped-down ``Flask``
application, and a testing suite written with ``unittest``.

See ``tests/test_application`` for a short example on how to handle different scenarios where users with different
permissions are able to see different things.
